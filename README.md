# HTTP Server in C

This repository holds code for each of my "milestones" to building a HTTP server in C. Read more about the [project on my website](https://ashleyliew.com/current/http-server-from-scratch.html).

Milestones Achieved So Far
- Echo server and client with UNIX sockets
- Server binded to localhost
